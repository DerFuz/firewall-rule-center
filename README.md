# Firewall Rule Center

This project is a prototype of a REST API Backend for documenting simple Layer-3/Layer-4 network firewall rules. It should help administrators to keep the desired state of these rules in one place and provide this information as a single-source-of-truth. It was written by *Jakob WÃ¶lfl* as part of a bachelors thesis.
